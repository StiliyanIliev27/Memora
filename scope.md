# Memora ‚Äì Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Memora is an interactive world map where people can save and share their memories with others. Users can create accounts, connect with partners, friends, or groups, and mark locations with shared photos, notes, or videos. Each relationship type has a distinct symbol (‚ù§Ô∏è for couples, ‚≠ê for friends, üéâ for groups), allowing memories to be visually organized.
